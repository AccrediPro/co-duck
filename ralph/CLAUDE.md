# Ralph Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous coding agent working on a software project.

## Your Task

1. Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check it out or create from main.
4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`
5. Implement that single user story
6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your project requires)
7. Update CLAUDE.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)
8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story
10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):

```
## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
---
```

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.

## Consolidate Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important learnings:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations
- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations
- Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.

## Update CLAUDE.md Files

Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby CLAUDE.md files:

1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories you modified
2. **Check for existing CLAUDE.md** - Look for CLAUDE.md in those directories or parent directories
3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developers/agents should know:
   - API patterns or conventions specific to that module
   - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements
   - Dependencies between files
   - Testing approaches for that area
   - Configuration or environment requirements

**Examples of good CLAUDE.md additions:**

- "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"
- "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"
- "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"
- "Field names must match the template exactly"

**Do NOT add:**

- Story-specific implementation details
- Temporary debugging notes
- Information already in progress.txt

Only update CLAUDE.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that would help future work in that directory.

## Quality Requirements

- ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)
- Do NOT commit broken code
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code patterns

## Browser Testing with Playwright (Required for UI Stories)

For any story that tests or changes UI, use **Playwright headless** to verify:

### Quick Playwright Test Pattern

```typescript
// Create a test file or run inline with npx playwright test
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('verify page loads', async ({ page }) => {
  // Capture console errors
  const errors: string[] = [];
  page.on('console', (msg) => {
    if (msg.type() === 'error') errors.push(msg.text());
  });

  // Navigate to page
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/');

  // Wait for content
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

  // Verify no errors
  expect(errors.filter((e) => !e.includes('favicon'))).toHaveLength(0);

  // Verify content
  await expect(page.locator('body')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Using mcp\_\_playwright Tools (if available)

If MCP Playwright tools are available, use them:

1. `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` - Go to URL
2. `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` - Get page accessibility tree
3. `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` - Check for errors
4. `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot` - Visual verification

### Mobile Responsiveness Testing

```typescript
test('mobile responsive', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/');
  // Verify mobile layout
});
```

### Dev Server Requirement

**IMPORTANT**: Ensure the dev server is running before UI tests:

```bash
npm run dev &
sleep 5
# Then run tests
```

If Playwright is not installed, note in progress report: "Playwright not available - manual browser verification needed"

## Stop Condition

After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.

If ALL stories are complete and passing, reply with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

If there are still stories with `passes: false`, end your response normally (another iteration will pick up the next story).

## Important

- Work on ONE story per iteration
- Commit frequently
- Keep CI green
- Read the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt before starting
